## DRM commands in linux

| Command | Explanation |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ```qsub``` | Submits a batch job for execution in compute node.  |
| ```qlogin``` |  Qlogin is similar to qsh in that it submits an interactive job to the queuing  system.  It does  not open an xterm(1) window on the X display, but uses the current terminal for user I/O. Example ```qlogin -l cuda=1 -binding linear:3```|
| ```qstat``` | used to request the status of jobs, queues, or a batch  server. |
| ```qdel``` |  A  batch  job  is  deleted by sending a request to the batch server that manages the batch job. |
